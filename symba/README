Note: If you're using the FD-lab scripts to run experiments, there are
a couple of things that have to be changed (in case that you run the
planner calling the plan script that we provide you can ignore all
this). We made change on the translator and preprocessor so you cannot
re-use the preprocessed files from another planners. Also, the
preprocessor needs to receive "--opt-ordering" as parameter. Our plan
script already does that, but using FD-lab will skip that part so a
workaround is needed (e.g, modify the code of preprocess to put
opt-ordering to true as default).
