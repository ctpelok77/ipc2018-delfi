The two instances of simple-logistics-domain.pddl, p01.pddl and
p02.pddl can be used to test finding symmetries: the first one, when
stabilizing both the initial state and the goal, does not contain
symmetries, while the second one does (swap place0/1, truck0/1,
crate0/1). The first one also contains a symmetry if not stabilizing
the initial state (swap place0/1).
